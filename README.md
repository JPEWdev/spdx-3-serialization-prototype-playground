# spdx-3-serialization-prototype-playground
TEMPORARY repo to contain different draft examples for SPDX 3.0 serializations.

This repository is an open playground to experiment with different serialization formats and approaches for the SPDX 3.0 spec.

Once we have decided on the officially supported SPDX serializations, they will be documented in other repositories and this repository will be deleted.

## Directory Structure
Each serialization approach will be in a separate sub-directory.
The sub-directory will contain a README.md file with background on the serialization approach, a description on the different examples, and a link to any tools that can parse these files.

## Contributing
All contributions are licensed under CC0 - please sign-off any commits.

New serialization approaches should be in their own directories with an appropriate README.md file.

We will do a minimum review of new proposals before merging.

Suggestions to existing serialization approaches sill be reviewed by the contributors of the original serializations approach before merging.
